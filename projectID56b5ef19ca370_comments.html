<HTML><BODY>This book, of a fictional voyage to an "inner" world, is an example of early science fiction. It uses the concept of a hollow Earth first explored in <i>Niels Klim's journey under the ground</i> by Ludvig Holberg (PG: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27884">27884</a>) and best known from Jules Verne (<i>A Journey into the Interior of the Earth</i>, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3748">3748</a>).

<p>This book appeared under a pseudonym. The author is most likely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cleves_Symmes,_Jr.">John Cleves Symmes, Jr.</a>.

<p>Some copies of the text are already available on-line, but by redoing it here, the text can be added to PG. I will investigate whether we can skip one or two rounds by comparing the results of P2 with the on-line texts.
